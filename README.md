# Word Web Pro Clone

This project is a part of my journey in learning web development, specifically focusing on HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I am attempting to clone the "Word Web Pro" website, which is a dictionary and thesaurus website. The original website, owned by its respective creators, can be found [here](https://wordweb.info/).
